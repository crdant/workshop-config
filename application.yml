  title: "Pivotal Cloud Foundry Workshop"
  date: "April 7, 2017"
  description: |
     <p>This workshop is targeted at developers and their managers who want to understand how a cloud-native approach
     changes the rules for enterprise integration. New development approaches and architecture shift the focus of an intergration
     team and enable new services models.</p>

     <p>We’ll steadily build the level of detail that we cover, providing opportunities for managers to learn about the broader themes
     while leaving the code-level topics for their teams. When we get into the details, we’ll be focusing on Java but touching on
     other languages as well.</p>
